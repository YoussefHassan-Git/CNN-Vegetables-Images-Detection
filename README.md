## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is designed to classify 15 different types of vegetables using a CNN model. By applying deep learning techniques, the model identifies vegetables like **tomato**, **carrot**, **potato**, etc., from a collection of images with high accuracy.

## 🥒 Dataset

The dataset used consists of 15 categories of vegetables:
1. 🥦 Broccoli
2. 🫑 Capsicum
3. 🍈 Bottle Gourd
4. 🌱 Radish
5. 🍅 Tomato
6. 🍆 Brinjal
7. 🎃 Pumpkin
8. 🥕 Carrot
9. 🍈 Papaya
10. 🥬 Cabbage
11. 🌿 Bitter Gourd
12. 🥦 Cauliflower
13. 🌽 Bean
14. 🥒 Cucumber
15. 🥔 Potato

Each category contains multiple images for training, validation, and testing purposes. Below is an example from the dataset:

## 🏗 Model Architecture

The model architecture is built using CNN layers to process the images. The architecture consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extracting features from input images (2 Layers).
- **Max Pooling Layers**: Reducing dimensionality and computational load (2 Layers).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification into 15 categories (3 Layers).
- **Softmax Activation**: For multi-class classification (1 Layer).

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the images into the model:
- **Images are resized** to 150x150 pixels for uniformity.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are scaled between 0 and 1.
- **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations like rotations, flips, and zooms are applied to increase the diversity of training samples.

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training and Evaluation

The model was trained with:
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Loss, F1-Score
- **Training/Validation Split**: 80/20
- **Epochs**: 10
